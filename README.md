# Stoplight CircleCI Orb

[stoplight](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/nebulab/stoplight)

## Description

This Orb can be used to publish your API documentation to [Stoplight](https://stoplight.io) as part
of your CI process.

## Usage

Add the following to your CircleCI configuration:

```yaml
version: 2.1

orbs:
  stoplight: nebulab/stoplight

workflows:
  cool-workflow:
    jobs:
      - stoplight/push:
          organization: your-stoplight-org
          project: your-stoplight-project
          git_token: $STOPLIGHT_GIT_TOKEN
          source_dir: stoplight-contents-dir
          username: $STOPLIGHT_USERNAME
      - stoplight/publish:
          api_token: $STOPLIGHT_API_TOKEN
          domain: your-site.docs.stoplight.io
          requires:
            - stoplight/push
```

Then set the `STOPLIGHT_USERNAME`, `STOPLIGHT_API_TOKEN` and `STOPLIGHT_GIT_TOKEN` environment
variables (this is sensitive information so it shouldn't go in your `.circleci/config.yml`).
